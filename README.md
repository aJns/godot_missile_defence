## TODOs

Keep this short and sweet! Preferably <= 5 items

- [ ] Separate Missile and Explosion scenes
- [ ] Create a missile class hierarchy
    * Projectile super class
        * Rocket class for "dumb" enemy projectiles
        * PlayerMissile for player missiles (duh)
- [ ] Explosions destroy missiles and damage the city

## Tips and notes

* Use groups to make finding explosions, missiles, player objects easy
